				<p>Cornwell House is our residential care home in Ferring, just a mile from Worthing, West Sussex. We were opened in 1982 by Joan and Bill Cornwell, after whom the house is named, and we currently provide space for twenty residents. Cornwell House is the third stage of care that Abbeyfield Ferring offers, where our clients live with us indefinitely. We offer full support, including personal care (bathing etc) and are staffed 24 hours a day by a dedicated staff who aim to provide the best quality care to our residents. Respite care and short-term stays are possible, subject to availability. We are located centrally in the village, close to local shops and conveniences.</p>

				<p>We strongly believe that our residents should be treated as unique individuals within the house and that we should be flexible in helping them to meet their needs.</p>

				<p>We provide rooms in which people can really live. We encourage our residents to bring in their own furniture and belongings so that they can feel more at home. All of our rooms are en-suite, and have all the facilities that you would expect.</p>

				<p>Our two dedicated cooks prepare all of our meals at the house with natural local ingredients, which are then served in our bright and airy dining room. Everything is extremely hygienic, and we've recently received a Level 5 Environmental Health Award from inspectors. Our residents can also take their meals in their room if they prefer - again, we like to be flexible.</p>

				<p>For the enjoyment of residents, we have two sun lounges that can be used for relaxing as well as an extensive back garden with a sun house. We also have regular activities arranged throughout each week.</p>
