				<h3 class="title title-right">Our Rooms</h3>
			
				<p>All bedrooms have an en-suite toilet and washbasin. We also have two assisted bathrooms and an assisted shower room. <strong>All of the rooms are linked to the care home’s emergency call system</strong> so that residents can summon assistance from a member of staff at any time of day or night.  A television and telephone point is fitted into each bedroom, and <strong>residents can have their own telephone line installed</strong> should they want to.</p>
				
				<p>Rooms are decorated to a high standard and in a style which is in keeping with the homely atmosphere that we try to maintain. <strong>Residents are encouraged to personalise their rooms by bringing in small items of furniture and belongings</strong> if they wish. Any electrical items brought into the home will need to be checked to be certain that they are safe for use. Each bedroom has a private lockable storage facility for personal or valuable items.</p>

				<p><strong>Residents’ relatives, friends and representatives are always welcome</strong> in the home, and to stay for meals (for which a small charge is made).</p>

				<p>Admission to the home is usually by prior arrangement, following a Care Assessment by the Home Manager to ensure that the resident’s care needs can be met. <strong>All prospective residents are invited to view the home</strong> prior to admission and spend time with a member of the care team who will answer any questions that they may have.</p>

				<p>Unless there are exceptional circumstances, <strong>we do not normally accept emergency admissions</strong>, but as mentioned we will accept respite care should there be a room available.</p>
