				<h2 class="title">The Abbeyfield Ferring Society</h2>

				<p>The Abbeyfield Ferring Society was <strong>founded to provide very high standards of care</strong> for the older residents of Ferring and our local area. We provide <a href="../homehelp">help at home</a>, <a href="../supported">supported living</a> and <a href="../residential">residential care</a>.</p>

				<p>We are a member of <a href="">the <strong>Abbeyfield Society</a>, a national and international network of high quality care services</strong> and care homes with more than 9,500 people in 720 houses. We believe in the guiding principles of Abbeyfield and being a part of this organisation provides us with oversight and support for everything that we do.</p>

				<p><strong>Evidence of our high quality care provision</strong> include: a favourable Care Quality Commission Report (2013); the Abbeyfield Gold Star Award (2013); and a five star Environmental Health rating (2015).</p>

				<p><strong>The Abbeyfield Ferring Society was founded in 1980</strong> by the late Bill Cornwell and his wife Joan. We are a non-profit making registered charity. You can <a href="#history">learn more about our history below</a>.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Our Care Philosophy</h2>

				<p>The care philosophy of our residential, supported and “help in your home” care services is to <strong>allow older people to retain as much of their independence as they would wish, while doing so safely</strong>. All of our staff are enhanced DBS checked.</p>

				<p>The principles of dignity, privacy, independence, confidentiality and choice have long been the cornerstones upon which quality care is based. We endeavour to provide services that promote high standards and quality of care. <strong>We respect the views of our residents and clients and welcome their comments</strong> to ensure that the best possible care service is provided at all times. All of our services are tailored specifically to the individual needs of each resident or client.</p>

				<p>To achieve all of this, we actively employ <strong>carers with the necessary skills and attributes</strong> to meet the needs of our residents and clients. Our training programme ensures that skills are maintained and built upon and staff development is an on-going process. We recognise that our staff are our most valuable asset, and pride ourselves that we have many long standing members of staff, who help to create a friendly and supportive environment for everyone.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Our Leadership</h2>

				<p>We are aware that leadership and effective management is central to all of our operations, and residents can expect an approach that <strong>creates an open, positive and inclusive atmosphere</strong>.</p>

				<p>We are governed by a group of local volunteers, who as Trustees form the Executive Committee. The Committee is legally responsible for the Abbeyfield Ferring Society. <strong>The Trustees, including the Chairman, have a wide range of valuable skills and expertise</strong>. The members of the Executive Committee are Charity Trustees and must ensure that the Society uses all of its resources for the benefit of the older people it was set up to serve. The Trustees meet regularly with the service managers and carry out regular visits to our care services on a rota basis, to maintain links with both residents and staff.</p>

				<h2 class="title">A Word from our Chairman, Ian Dyke</h2>

				<p>I first became involved in Abbeyfield Ferring when <strong>my mother moved into <a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a> in 2006</strong>. She was very reluctant to move from her bungalow and give up her independence, but was finding it very difficult to continue running her own home.</p>

				<p>Within a few weeks of moving into Cornwell House <strong>she was very much a part of the Abbeyfield family</strong> having received such a warm welcome from the staff and other residents. She spent three very happy and worry free years in the home and never regretted making the decision to move.</p>

				<p>Nothing has changed since and our aim remains the same, to make sure that our residents feel part of the Abbeyfield family from day one. Our number one task will always be to <strong>create a warm, friendly and welcoming atmosphere</strong> at <a href="../supported">Old School House</a> and <a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a> as part of the Abbeyfield ethos.</p>

				<a name="history"></a>

				<h2 class="title">Our History</h2>

				<p>The Society was founded by Bill and Joan Cornwell in 1980. <strong>They recognised the growing number of older and often lonely people</strong> living in Ferring who could no longer manage for themselves and might have to move away from the village. Following enthusiastic support for their ideas, the first house, which accommodated six residents, was opened in April 1982. This was subsequently named “<a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a>” after the founders.</p>

				<p>To meet further needs, <strong>a second house was built right in the centre of Ferring village</strong> on the site of the old school. “<a href="../supported">Old School House</a>” was opened in 1985 and now provides housing for another eleven local people.</p>

				<p><strong>Our “<a href="../homehelp">Help in your Home</a>” or Domiciliary service was introduced in 2000</strong> to provide care and support for those in the community wishing to remain in their own homes and to offer respite to the many relatives and friends who are perhaps committed to full-time care.</p>

				<p>Bill and Joan’s intention was always to provide an <strong>open, positive and inclusive environment</strong> in the services that they helped to build, and we continue to strive to do so to this day.</p>
