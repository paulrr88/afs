				<h2 class="title">The Abbeyfield Ferring Society</h2>
				
				<p>The Abbeyfield Ferring Society exists to provide very high standards of care for the elderly residents of Ferring and our local area in West Sussex, whether we're providing <a href="../homehelp">care at home</a> or at one of our two care homes (<a href="../supported">Old School House</a> and <a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a>). Evidence of our high quality care provision include: a favourable Care Quality Commission Report (2013); the Abbeyfield Gold Star Award (2013); and a five star Environmental Health rating (2013).</p>

				<p>We are a member of <a href="http://www.abbeyfield.com/">the Abbeyfield group</a>, a network of high quality care homes and care services all across the country, with more than 9,500 people in 720 houses. We believe in the principles of Abbeyfield and all of their requirements - being a part of this organisation provides us with oversight and support for everything that we do.</p>
				
				<p>The Abbeyfield Ferring Society began in 1980 and continues to flourish to this day. We are a non-profit making registered charity which aims to be flexible and innovative in order to further promote the highest possible care standards.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Our Care Style</h2>
				
				<p>We aim to keep our residents and staff happy and motivated in a friendly and supportive environment. In our view, a contented staff equals contented residents. Many of our staff have been with us for decades, and love working for us. Our residents are given the freedom to live as they like, and can participate in any number of activities throughout the week (further details on these can be found on our <a href="../residential">residential care</a> and <a href="../supported">supported living care</a> pages). We also hold various events throughout the year, dates for which can be found <a href="../#events">on the home page</a>.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Our Leadership</h2>
		
				<p>As mentioned earlier, we are a non-profit organisation, which means we're governed by a group of volunteers who act as an executive committee for us. These trustees are concerned with looking out for the well-being of residents, domiciliary clients, and the maintenance of our care homes. They come from a variety of backgrounds (including teaching and the health profession) and meet regularly with our service managers (who head up <a href="../#services">our various care services</a>) to ensure that we have a varied and real-world perspective on the care services that we provide.</p>

				<h2 class="title">A Word from our Chairman, Ian Dyke</h2>
		
				<p>I first became involved in Abbeyfield Ferring when my mother moved into <a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a> in 2006. She was very reluctant to move from her bungalow and give up her independence, but was finding it very difficult to continue running her own home.</p>
				
				<p>Within a few weeks of moving into Cornwell House she was very much a part of the Abbeyfield family having received such a warm welcome from the staff and other residents. She spent three very happy and worry free years in the home and never regretted making the decision to move.</p>
				
				<p>Nothing has changed since and our aim remains the same, to make sure that our residents feel part of the Abbeyfield family from day one. Our number one task will always be to create a warm, friendly and welcoming atmosphere at <a href="../supported">Old School House</a> and <a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a> as part of the Abbeyfield ethos.</p>
