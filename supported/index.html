				<p>At Old School House <strong>we offer quality supported living accommodation, very close to local conveniences in the heart of Ferring village</strong>. Supported living is the second stage of care offered by Abbeyfield Ferring.</p>

				<p>Old School House was opened in 1985 to meet the needs of people from the local area. <strong>We give the over 65s the independence of having their own “studio” room</strong>, with the added security of an alarm system, a House Manager on site Monday to Friday and daily support from our Home Companions (and all of our staff are enhanced DBS checked).</p>

				<p><strong>We are here to ensure that you feel safe, secure and comfortable</strong>. Short-term and respite stays are available. We currently provide capacity for eleven people to stay with us.</p>

				<p><strong>Our residents are encouraged to remain as independent as possible</strong>. However, if someone requires additional services, such as personal care (for instance help with bathing), this may be purchased from a domiciliary service (such as our “<a href="../homehelp">Help in your Home</a>” service) or arranged through social services. Some financial support may be available, through a range of benefits and entitlements, depending on a person’s circumstances.</p>

				<p>All of our rooms have an <strong>en-suite WC, along with a kitchenette equipped for making breakfast, light snacks and drinks</strong>. Residents are welcome to furnish their room to their personal taste with items from their home. We provide two home cooked meals every day, freshly prepared on site by our cooks using locally sourced good quality food.</p>

				<p>Our house has a ground and first floor, <strong>equipped with a lift</strong> for those less able and handrails placed around the entire building. We have a pleasant <strong>walled garden and sun conservatory</strong> for the enjoyment of our residents and two cosy living room spaces, one with a communal dining area.</p>

				<p>We strive to maintain a <strong>homely community atmosphere</strong> at Old School House. Our Home Companions are always on hand during the day to offer conversation and support, and we encourage our residents to meet together and get to know one another. As part of this, we have a <strong>programme of weekly activities</strong> that they can participate in.</p>

				<p>The lovely village of Ferring maintains a real sense of community, with <strong>several shops, a Village Hall, library, GP surgery, dentist, a local historic Anglican Church</strong> (all of which are within yards of Old School House) and much more. There are several local beauty spots to be enjoyed with pleasant walks, The Twittens green being the closest to us. Local buses run a frequent service to Worthing, Rustington, Brighton and other locations, enabling our residents to continue to “get out and about” and lead fulfilling lives.</p>
