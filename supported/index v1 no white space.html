				<p>At Old School House we offer quality supported living care in Ferring. Old School House was opened after <a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a>, in what used to be Ferring's local primary school before the Ferring C.E. School was established, hence our name.</p>
				
				<p>Supported living is the second stage of care offered by Abbeyfield Ferring. You may have heard various terms for supported living care - to be clear, what we offer is the same as sheltered and assisted living.</p>
				
				<p>We prefer the term supported as we are here to support those that choose to stay with us, and to give them what they need while allowing them to live their own life. Short-term and respite stays are available. We currently have the capacity for eleven people to stay with us.</p>
				
				<p>Our guests are capable of looking after their own personal care needs, but often need help with other tasks, such as getting around. Guests can also use our <a href="../homehelp">home care service</a> for additional support if they need it.</p>

				<p>Lorraine has been helping us to provide quality supported living care in Ferring for more than ten years now.</p>
				
				<p>She manages everything at the house with passion and dedication. In her words, it's quite like how she runs her own house! She keeps everything working and improving, and strongly believes in the principles of Abbeyfield, as do all of our service managers.</p>

				<h3 class="title">Community</h3>
				
				<p>We like to maintain a homely community atmosphere at Old School House. As part of this, we always encourage our guests to meet together and get to know one another, so that no-one feels alone in the house. Our staff act as companions, who are always there during daylight hours to offer conversation and support our guests with their needs.</p>
				
				<p>Those that choose to stay with us can bring in their own furniture and belongings, which is something that we also encourage at <a href="../residential">Cornwell House</a>. All of our rooms are en suite with a kitchenette equipped for making breakfasts and drinks.</p>

				<p>We have a pleasant walled garden and sun house/lounge for the enjoyment of guests, and a cosy living room space with communal dining room. All of our meals are made by our own personal cook with locally sourced, good quality food in a dedicated modern kitchen. You can be assured that everything is very hygienic, as we recently received a Level 5 Environmental Health Award.</p>

				<h3 class="title title-right">Safety</h3>
				
				<p>We take the safety of those who stay with us very seriously. We are staffed from 8am to 7pm except on Saturdays, and when our staff aren't present we use the usual emergency pendant system and care line. The house is equipped with emergency cords and a lift as well, as well as the usual security precautions that you would expect.</p>

				<h3 class="title">Freedom</h3>
				
				<p>Our guests can leave whenever they want to go out, just for a walk in the lovely village that Old School House is a part of, or further afield. We are just across the road from local facilities (including several shops and bus stops) and near to local beauty spots, such as the Twittons park (where cricket is played regularly!) and the local historic Anglican church.</p>
				
				<p>The village is independent, not a district of Worthing, and has a very large population of retired folk. People want to live here! As mentioned, there are two bus stops only a few yards from us that run to Portsmouth, Chichester, Worthing, and Brighton. We do have a check-in board in the house that we ask people to use to let us know who is in and who is out at any given time, just for peace of mind.</p>

				<p>Our guests can also stay in with us and participate in some of the activities that we hold regularly if they like, such as light exercise and poetry groups! We also hold coffee mornings at various times of year.</p>
