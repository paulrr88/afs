				<h2 class="title">How we Help</h2>
				
				<p>This service provides quality help in your home in Ferring and the surrounding area. This is the first stage of care offered by Abbeyfield Ferring. We provide help with shopping, housework (such as laundry, ironing, etc), cooking meals, trips and appointments, collecting pensions, and more.</p>
				
				<p>We do not presently offer personal care; however, we hope to be able to include this by the end of 2014. This will enable us to offer help with dressing, bathing, and administering medication, allowing us to further enable our clients to maintain their current lifestyle, which is always our primary aim.</p>

				<p>We currently provide our services to dozens of clients in various local areas including Ferring, Tarring, Rustington, East Preston, and Angmering. Our clients matter to us, and so our visits are on time, and we're available at whichever times and intervals that they require (including weekly, fortnightly, or one-off). We aim to provide a personal touch that is tailored to each individual's needs.</p>
				
				<p>All of our staff are DBS checked, and we offer very competitive rates. A consultation is always carried out and we follow this up with a written agreement between us and the client. We've been helping our clients stay longer in their own homes since 2001.</p>
				
				<p><strong>As ever, <a href="../contact">if you want to find out more, please do get in contact</a>.</strong></p>
